# nswadb #

nswadb is free and open source. There isâ€”

* a CSV database containing information on all General Assembly resolutions;

* Python scripts that generate a bbCode list of General Assembly 
  resolutions by author, as well as a number of associated bbCode tables 
  containing statistical information; and

* Parsing code to poll the NS API to generate an updated version of that database, along with code necessary to properly
  capitalise names, categories, etc. **You should check automated parser output for errors.**
